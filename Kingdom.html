                Born in the Warring States period of the central plains, Shin and Hyou are war-orphans in the state of Qin who both dream of becoming the "Greatest Generals of the Heavens" to rise from their lowly stations as slaves in life. One day, however, Hyou is taken to the palace by a minister to be used for unknown purposes, leaving Shin alone as a household servant in their hometown.
                A few months later, Hyou returns to the village on the verge of death, urging Shin to travel to another village called Kokuhi village, a full of vagabonds and thugs. There he meets a boy who looks nearly identical to Hyou, Ei Sei, the current King of Qin, and a strange lookout for the village called Ka Ryo Ten. Shin learns that his best friend served as a body double for Ei Sei and was mortally wounded in a power struggle for the throne. Though initially enrage at Ei Sei for causing Hyou's death, Shin decides to seize the opportunity and aid the young king in defeating his younger half-brother and reclaim the Qin throne.
                Successful in this endeavor, Shin officially starts his life as a Qin soldier on the battlefields of the Warring States with the goal of becoming the "Greatest General in the World" as a Great General underneath the Heavens, and to help the young king of Qin achieve his dream of total Unification of the central plains, ending the incessant strife, warfare once and for all.
