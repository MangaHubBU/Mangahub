                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-top: 13px;">Luffy grew up on Dawn Island in Windmill Village located in East Blue. He was inspired to become a pirate like his idol, Red Haired Shanks. 
                        Luffy constantly wanted to join Shank's crew but was denied because he was a kid. Completely by accident, Luffy ate the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit that Shanks had brought back from the Grand Line. 
                        Luffy was nearly killed by Higuma, the mountain bandit, by throwing him into the sea. He was saved from the local sea monster by Shanks, but he had lost his right arm in the process.
                        Before Shanks left, Luffy swore that one day he'd have a crew of his own and become king of the pirates. Suddenly, Shanks placed his straw hat onto Luffy's head with the promise he would return it after he became a great pirate.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-top: 13px;">As a young boy, Zoro had tried to challenge the dojo master at Frost Moon Village, but he offered Zoro to face his young daughter, Kuina, who was only a few years older than himself. 
                            Zoro was defeated, and he stayed to train. No matter how hard he trained, he was always defeated by Kuina. When Kuina said that she would eventually lose to Zoro because he is a boy, he hated the idea he's win just becasue of biology. 
                            He made a promise that he and Kuina would become the greatest swordsman in the world then decide who was the best. However, Kuina soon died in a tragic accident. They would never get to live up to their promise. After her funeral, Zoro has Kuina's father for her sword, the Wado Ichimonji. 
                            He would use her sword to achieve their dream. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-top: 13px;">When Sanji was young he worked aboard the Cruise Orbit as a cook, when Zeff (or Red Leg Zeff as he had been named) and his crew attacked the ship. As Zeff's crew boarded the ship, a sudden storm struck, and both ships were sunk. 
                                As the ships were being torn apart, Sanji called out his dream to find All Blue (an ocean were fish from every sea could be found) and Zeff swam to him, saving him from drowning. The two washed up onto a rock formation high above the sea, and although their lives were saved, they were low on food.
                                The rock had no vegetation, animals, or means of fishing, and as a result food needed to be rationed. Zeff gave a small bag to Sanji and told him to stretch the food out so he wouldn't starve to death. </p>
