            <p style="text-align: justify;">Grotesque, towering monsters called kaiju have been appearing around Japan for many years. To combat these beasts, an elite military unit known as the Defense Force risks their lives daily to protect civilians. Once a creature is killed, "sweepers"—working under the Professional Kaiju Cleaner Corporation Monster Sweeper Inc. — are left to dispose of its remains.
                Kafka Hibino, a 32-year-old man, is unsatisfied with his job as a sweeper. From a young age, he has aspired to join the Defense Force and kill kaiju for a living. After a few failed attempts, however, he gave up on his dreams and resigned himself to the mediocrity that provided a decent paycheck. Nevertheless, when an ambitious, 18-year-old recruit named Leno Ichikawa joins his cleaning team, Kafka is once again reminded of his desire to join the military.
                Following a chain of unfortunate events and an interaction with the junior sweeper, Kafka encounters a unknown flying kaiju that forces its way in through his mouth—turning him into a humanoid monster, Kaiju No. 8. With his newfound powers, Kafka aims to give his lifelong dream a final try.
