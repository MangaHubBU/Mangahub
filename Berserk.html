            <div class="manga-line"></div>
            <p>Berserk is a story that follows the story of Guts; a swordsman whose very existence has been Hell since he was born. Guts ends up suffering through a lot of traumatic events but ends up finding two opportunities to rise above his trauma. The first time is when he joins up with a mercenary company named The Band of the Hawk, led by a man named Griffith. Griffith is a man many would willingly follow into Hell but who no one understands. Through his interactions with Griffith and other members of the Band of the Hawk like Casca (his future love interest) and Judea, Guts decides that he wants to find his own reason for living after he helps see Griffith's dream come close to fruition. A year after leaving Guts finds out that Griffith had done something that got him imprisoned and the Band of the Hawk branded as criminals. He reunites with his fellow mercenaries, confides in Casca at a moment where they are most vulnerable, and helps rescue Griffith from prison. However, when they believe themselves to be home free, a supernatural event occurs which sees all of Gutsâ€™ friends slaughtered, save for Casca (who ends up being raped by Griffith and driven insane) and Rickert (who was away from the events to take care of some wounded before they were attacked by the same monsters.) Guts is maimed and left with the need to gain revenge on Griffith and those who he works with from the world beyond Earth.</p>
